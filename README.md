# Digital-Clock
This is a project for Digital Electronics where I built a Digital clock using Vivado which programs a Basys3 Board.
- The code is written in Verilog using the Vivado software.
- The Source files which contain the actual code can be found [here](project_2/project_2.srcs/sources_1)
- It has many features like :-
   - Clock : shown in the 7 Segment display, the time can be set
   - Stopwatch : in seconds and milliseconds, has features of start,stop and pause
   - Timer : Set to a certain number of minutes and seconds and when the time has passed an led blink
   - Alarm : Can be set to certain hours and minutes, when that time is reached by the clock an led blinks for 1 minute
